"""Web Surface implementation guide (stub).

Suggested stack: FastAPI + WebSocket.

Core ideas:
- WebSocket receives user input messages.
- Server calls `await engine.arun(...)`.
- Events are forwarded to the client as JSON.
- When a `run_paused` event is emitted, the client returns decisions,
  then the server calls `await engine.continue_run(run_id=..., decisions=...)`.
